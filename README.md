# abstract
We design a resource allocation framework for securing interdependent systems managed by multiple defenders. Our framework models these multi-defender interdependent systems with the notion of attack graphs. We propose three defense scenarios that are derived from the top attack paths that defenders predict, based on their system knowledge, which attackers may consider to launch their attacks. 

Furthermore, we propose a defense method with low sensitivity to the number of concurrent attacks, based on a graph-theoretical notion known as the Markov random field. We elucidate the advantages gained from our decision-making framework through its application to ten attack graphs (that includes multiple real-world interdependent systems). In particular, we quantify the level of security improvement under our defense methods compared to three well-known resource allocation algorithms. 

We demonstrate that our proposed framework leads to better resource allocations compared to these algorithms in most scenarios. We also conduct various comparisons under different parameter configurations (e.g., number of attacks, and defenders' security budgets) to demonstrate the superiority of our approachâ€™s outcomes. We show that our framework enhances security decision-making under various circumstances.
